Redfish Prompt: A clone of HTTP Prompt
======================================

This is an experimental extension of the http-prompt tool intended to be a playground to add Redfish-specific capabilities (see the [Redfish](https://www.dmtf.org/standards/redfish) pages at [DMTF.org](https://www.dmtf.org/) for more information on Redfish).

## Redfish-Prompt Tool

+ An interactive command line tool with auto-complete feature to navigate schema and talk to custom API endpoints.  
+ An automated traverser tool for navigating collections in a multi-level schema for a hypermedia API like Redfish.  
+ A promising tool for system mangers and network engineers to reach endpoints and handle critical parameters.
